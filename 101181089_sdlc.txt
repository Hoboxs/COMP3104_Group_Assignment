This is the file that cotains information about the Software Developement Cycle.


In systems engineering, information systems and software engineering, the systems development life cycle (SDLC), 
also referred to as the application development life-cycle, is a process for planning, creating, testing, 
and deploying an information system.The systems development life cycle concept applies to a range of 
hardware and software configurations, as a system can be composed of hardware only, software only, or a combination of both.
There are usually six stages in this cycle: 
requirement analysis, design, development and testing, implementation, documentation, and evaluation.
